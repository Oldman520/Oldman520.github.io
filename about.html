			&nbsp; Chi Alpha is a nationally appointed Christian campus ministry (not a fraternity or sorority) found on universities throughout the United States and around the world. We are groups of collegeâ€“aged men and women earnestly following Jesus. We invite everyone to be a part of our ministry, regardless of background. Our large group meetings are informal, infused with music and interaction, and cover topics from relationships to the nature of truth. We create opportunities for students to meet God, each other, and the needs of the community.
