					Chi-Alpha offers a variety of activities in each semester, you can
					really have the colorful life through attending this club. Here I will
					introduce two of the event which I really impressed.
				</p>
				<h1 style = "color:white;">Fall Retreat</h1>
				<img src = "images/retreat3.jpg" width ="350" height = "200" style = "float: right;">
				<p>
					Fall Retreat is similar with the camping trip, this trip offers us 
					an opportunity to be away from the winona and to aproach the nature.
					The location of the Fall Retreat of the year is at valley Creek Bible 
					Camp in Iowa State. The environment is far from the civilization, you
					can enjoy the beautiful view here as well !
				</p>
				
				<img src = "images/retreat2.jpg" width ="350" height = "200">
				<p style = "float: right;">
					There were also provided a lot of activities here, especially 
					the "color war", everyone will dress with the costume and have some 
					competing game for each other. For their dress, I think it is very 
					cool!
				</p>
				
				<img src = "images/retreat1.jpg" width ="350" height = "200" style = "float: right;">
				<p>
					Althogh it was quite lot of fun when we were playing games. Still, the
					spiritual formation is important,too. The Pastor Max shared a lot of wisdom 
					in his speech during the camping.

				<p>
					Chi-Alpha held an concert at the end of the summer vacation
					. They invited the band calld the Yam Haws, the sound performance
					was very awesome! Every member did their great job, the song <span style ="font-style: italic;">
					carry me home</span> which brought me a good ending in the summer vacation.
